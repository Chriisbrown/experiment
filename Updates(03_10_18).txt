Paramaters updated - (03/10/2018)
LXeDetectorConstruction
Added the fscint1 material instance with the correct density and H-C ratio

- all new scintillator added which has a consistent scintillation yield across energies. Also updated absorption length to 380cm and yield to 10,000 MeV as seen in some guide to scintillators online. Also Fast time constant - 0.9ns and Slow time constant 2.1ns
Refractive index - 1.58
Birks Constant - 0.126mm/MeV (needs looking into)

LXeMainVolume
Commented out two of the PMTs on the two faces unused

LXePrimaryGeneratorAction
particle position is now 10cm above
particle momentum is now 4GeV

LXeRunAction
PMT Histogram now go up to 1000
Energy Histogram now goes between 4 - 10MeV
